1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,600
And that's it for this module and for HttpRequests.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,660
You learned about two alternatives and how HttpRequests in general work, why we might want to send such

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,800
requests and how we do that.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:20,900
You learned how to add data, how to promisify XMLHttpRequest, how to handle errors,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,500
also with the fetch API where this is a bit more tricky and you learned about different data structures,

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,860
JSON and FormData.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,170
Now as I mentioned, there is of course way more you can do with HttpRequests,

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,260
it would be enough content for a separate course actually. The core parts were covered in this course though,

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,040
pretty extensively actually.
